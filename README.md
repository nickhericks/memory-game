# elbSafari - a memory game (Udacity project)

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. Demonstrates knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Introduction

This game is based on a classic style memory card game.

## How to play

A player clicks/taps cards to flip them over. If they match they turn green and remain. If the cards do not match, then the cards flip back over face down. The player wins when all cards are matched. The player loses if all cards are not matched in less than 40 moves.

## Special features

A star rating system is displayed and is based on the number of moves the player takes to match all the cards. If all matches are made in less than 28 moves, the player earns a three star rating. If player matches all cards in 28-35 moves the player earns a two star rating. If the player wins the game with 36-39 moves the player earns a one star rating.

## Todos

* Fix move counter to iterate on card sets (2 cards) clicked instead of each card clicked
* Animate card flip
* Swap text on card backs for photos
* Track and display number of wrong guesses
* Track and display % of guesses right
* Create numerical scoring system that includes both stars and time
